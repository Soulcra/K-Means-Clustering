# K-Means-Clustering
Clustering has many uses, including outlier detection and unsupervised image segmentation. The K-Means clustering algorithm is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms. 

Implement basic K-means algorithm to cluster the sample data set. Do not use built-in function
such as kmeans for clustering.
Two sample data sets (kmtest and iris) are provided. Make sure your program works with both data
sets.
